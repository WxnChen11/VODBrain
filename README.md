# VODBrain

VODBrain is a python library that automatically parses highlights from Twitch.TV streams based on chat history.
For a given stream, VODBrain analyzes the chat records to find anomalies in the time-series (e.g. moments that
indicate the chat is in a reactive state to an event of interest happening on the stream). When such an event is detected
VODBrain automatically downloads, converts, trims, and labels the relevant video clip.
